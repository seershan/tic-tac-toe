# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe project! This is a simple yet engaging web-based game of Tic-Tac-Toe, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project serves as a learning exercise to understand the basics of web development, including layout design, styling, and interactive scripting.

## Overview

This project is a straightforward implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with X and O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can click on the grid to place their marks.
- **Dynamic Game Logic**: The game checks for win conditions and declares the winner.
- **Responsive Design**: The game layout adapts to different screen sizes for optimal playability on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Restart Option**: Players can reset the game to play again without refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the game layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the game interface and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play

1. The game starts with Player 1 (X) taking the first turn.
2. Click on any empty square to place your mark.
3. Players alternate turns until one player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or all squares are filled (resulting in a draw).
4. A message will display the winner or indicate a draw.
5. Click the "Restart" button to play again.

## Lessons Learned

While working on this project, I learned:
- How to structure an HTML document and use semantic tags.
- Basic and advanced CSS techniques for layout and design.
- JavaScript fundamentals, including event handling, DOM manipulation, and implementing game logic.
- Debugging techniques and problem-solving skills.
